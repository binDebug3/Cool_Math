## Project Descriptions

### <a name="sound">Analyzing Sound Waves</a>
This project uses convolution ad the Fast Fourier Transform to analyze sound waves and images. I used it to modify the 
sound of a piano playing to make it sound like it is being played in a large concert hall. I also used it remove noise 
from an image of a license plate so that critical information would be easier to read..


### <a name="cropping">Seemlessly Inserting One Image into Another</a>
This project uses the Poisson Equation to insert one image into another and blur the boundary between the two images for 
a more convincing crop. The Poisson Equation is a partial differential equation that is used to find the potential of a vector field. In this project, I used it to find the potential of the gradient of an image, and then used the potential to insert one image into another. I found that I could insert one image into another and blur the boundary between the two images.


### <a name="denoising">Removing Noise and Blur from an Image</a>
This project uses Anistropic Diffusion to remove noise and blurring from an image. Anistropic Diffusion is a differential equation model that can be used to remove noise from an image that works by comparing each pixel to its neighbors and averaging 
differenes.


### <a name="enhancement">Enhancing a Noisy Image</a>
This project uses Total Variation to remove imperfections from an image. We can also use Total Variation in other applications, such
as finding the shortest path between two points on a surface or the slope that minimizes the amount of energy used to travel between two points.


### <a name="compression">Image Compression</a>
This project uses the singular value decomposition to compress images. The singular value decomposition is a powerful tool that can be used to find the principal components of a matrix. In this project, I used it to find the most important elements of the eigenbasis of an image. I then used the eigenbasis to reconstruct the image, and found that I could compress the image by 90% without losing much of the original information.


### <a name="segmentation">Image Segmentation</a>
This project uses the singular value decomposition to segment images. Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments. Singular value decomposition works by decomposing a matrix into three other matrices that represent the principal components of the original matrix. In this project, I used it to remove the background from a simple image.
