## Project Descriptions

### <a name="stability">How Your Computer Lies to You</a>
This project uses theory from conditioning and stability of computer algorithms to show how your computer can lie to you. Because computers represent numbers in a finite number of bits, they have to approximate numbers with too many significant digits, and can only represent numbers in a finite range. This means that when you perform a calculation on a computer, the result may not be exactly what you expect.


### <a name="nmf">Recommending Artists to Listeners with NMF</a>
This project uses non-negative matrix factorization to recommend artists to listeners. The non-negative matrix factorization is a powerful tool for finding patterns in data. In this project, I used it to find the patterns in a dataset of listeners and artists, and then used the patterns to recommend artists to listeners.


### <a name="optimization">How to Optimize Your Nutrition</a>
This projects uses the simplex method to optimize your nutrition. The simplex method is a powerful tool for solving linear programming problems. It is used to find the optimal solution to a linear programming problem. In this project, I used it to find the optimal combination of foods to eat to maximize the amount of nutrients you get while staying within your daily calorie limit.


### <a name="ranking">Google's Page Rank Algorithm</a>
This project uses the Page Rank algorithm to rank web pages. The Page Rank algorithm is a powerful tool for ranking a list of options using graph theory and adjacency matrices. In this project, I used it to ranks a small list of stanford's websites and to determine the best team to play in the first round of the NCAA tournament.


### <a name="bfs">inding Popular Actors with Graph Searching</a>
This project uses graph searching to find the most popular actors in a dataset of movies using the breadth-first search algorithm. I used the dataset of movies to create a graph of actors, where each actor is connected to the actors they have worked with. 


### <a name="recommender">Recommender System without Machine Learning</a>
This project uses non-negative matrix factorization to create a recommender system without using machine learning. The non-negative matrix factorization is a powerful tool.


### <a name="markov">How to Talk like Yoda</a>
This project uses Markov chains to create a Markov chain that can generate text that sounds like Yoda. Markov chains are a powerful tool for modeling random processes. In this project, I used it to model the way Yoda speaks. I used a dataset of all of Yoda's lines from the Star Wars movies, and then used the Markov chain to generate new lines that sound like Yoda.


### <a name="wordle">Solve Wordle with Entropy</a>
This project uses entropy to solve the game Wordle. Wordle is a game where you have to guess a five letter word in six tries. After each guess, you are told which letters are in the word, and which letters are in the correct position. I used information theory to find the word that will give the most information for guessing it.
