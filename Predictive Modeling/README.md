## Project Descriptions

### <a name="arma">Making Predictions with ARMA Models</a>
This project is an exploration of ARMA models, a class of statistical models that are used to make predictions about time series data. The goal is to understand how different parameters affect the accuracy of the predictions, and to find the optimal model that minimizes the error in the predictions by finding patterns in noise.

### <a name="chaos">Modeling Chaos with Lorenz Equations</a>
This project is an exploration and visualization of the Lorenz Equations, a set of three ordinary differential equations that exhibit chaotic behavior. The Lorenz Equations are a simplified model of atmospheric convection, and were first studied by Edward Lorenz in 1963.


### <a name="entropy">Understanding Entropy and Heat Flow</a>
This project is an exploration of entropy and heat flow in different systems. The system is modeled by a set of ordinary differential equations, and the goal is to find the optimal temperature distribution that minimizes the entropy of the system.


### <a name="hiv">Finding the Optimal HIV Treatment with Control Theory</a>
This project explores the use of control theory to find the optimal treatment strategy for HIV. The system is modeled by a set of ordinary differential equations, and the goal is to find the optimal drug dosages that minimize the viral load in the patient.


### <a name="pendulum">Balancing an Inverted Pendulum (aka walking)</a>
This project deals with the problem of balancing an inverted pendulum, which is a classic problem in control theory. The goal is to design a controller that can balance the pendulum in the upright position, and then move it to a desired position. This is a simplified model of the surprisingly difficult problem of walking.


### <a name="obstacle">Route Planning around Obstacles with Control Theory</a>
This project explores the use of control theory to plan a route around obstacles. The system is modeled by a set of ordinary differential equations, and the goal is to find the optimal path that avoids the obstacles and minimizes the time to reach the destination.


### <a name="sir">Modeling Disease Spread with SIR Models</a>
This project is an exploration of the SIR model, a simple mathematical model that describes the spread of a disease in a population. The goal is to understand how different parameters affect the spread of the disease through Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered populations.


### <a name="timber">Maximizing Profit from Timber Harvesting</a>
This project explores the use of optimization techniques to maximize the profit from timber harvesting. The goal is to find the optimal cutting schedule that maximizes the profit from selling timber, while taking into account the growth rate of the trees and the cost of harvesting.
